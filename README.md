Overview

You will also need to use several techniques regarding data types and arithmetic, in order to manipulate the numeric values involved.  You will also develop some tests to help ensure your class is working properly.

Details

Start a new project in Eclipse for this assignment.  In this project, you’ll develop a class called FuelMonitor in the edu.vt.cs5044 package that models the behavior of an automobile’s fuel gauge and miles-per-gallon calculator.  A basic template of the required class file is provided to help get you started.  You should assume that the methods of your class will be called by other components within the vehicle (but external to this assignment).  Each method’s required behavior is already described by Javadoc comments in the provided source code file; these comments act as your requirements by specifying the expected behavior for each method.

You have freedom to choose the number and types of instance variables you use, the approaches to the calculations, and other such internal design considerations.  This is the most fundamental concept of encapsulation in an object-oriented system.  It doesn’t matter exactly how your class works, as long as it works properly whenever the public accessor and mutator methods are invoked.  There are many possible designs, and there is no single “right” or “best” solution that meets all of the functional expectations.

However, we’re also taking this opportunity to start to practice development in the idiomatic style of Java, so please be sure to review the project grading rubric and follow its guidelines to maximize your score from the human review process.  Of course you may always ask for help in the forum at any time!

Note that this class isn’t a complete stand-alone program.  It can’t be launched on its own, as it doesn’t include a main() method.  Further, no methods accept any user input, nor do any methods produce any user output.  This is intentional!  This class is meant to be just one small component of a much larger system.

Still, you obviously need to execute your code somehow, to ensure that it works correctly.  To do this, you’ll need to develop a second class called FuelMonitorTester (also in the edu.vt.cs5044 package) in order to exercise your FuelMonitor class.  Your tester class should generally use System.out.println() to display both the expected and the actual results to the console, as suggested in the textbook.  A basic tester class is provided, to get you started, and you’re expected to add some more test cases to this.
